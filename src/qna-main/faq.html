                    <a href="#">How to download free VCE files?</a>
                    <p>You need to have an ExamCollection account to be able to download free VCE files. You can register your account here.

                        Account creation is a two-step process: first you enter your email address, and then you need to confirm ownership of this email address. Ownership can be confirmed in 2 ways:
                        1. Check your mailbox and find the email message from support@examcollection.com: it contains a confirmation link. Just click on it and your account will be activated.
                        2. Send an email message to confirm@examcollection.com. After that, your account will be activated within 5 minutes.</p>

                    <p>If you do not see emails from us, that's most likely because they have landed to your Spam/Junk folder. Please check these folders, and once you find an email from support@examcollection.com, open it and remove the Spam label. To prevent examcollection.com messages from being marked as Spam in the future, add <a href="#">support@examcollection.com</a> to your email address book, so it is recognized as a trusted email.
